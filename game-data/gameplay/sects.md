### Choosing to Be Sectless

Players can choose **not to join any Sect**, remaining independent in Jianghu.

**Benefits**:
- No rule restrictions or penalties
- Freedom to explore all playstyles without consequences
- No Precept Value, Karma, or Virtue tracking

**Drawbacks**:
- **No access to Sect shops** (miss out on exclusive cosmetics)

## Benefits of Joining a Sect

### 1. Unique Items from Sect Shops

Each Sect operates an **exclusive shop** that offers cosmetics and items unavailable to non-members or members of other Sects.

**Shop Features**:
- **Exclusive Cosmetics**: Unique appearance items themed around Sect identity
- **Reputation-Gated Items**: Higher-tier items unlock as Sect rank increases
- **Sect-Specific Consumables**: Special items that align with Sect mechanics

**Progression**: As you increase your reputation and rank within the Sect, more items become available in the shop.

**Important**: Items from one Sect's shop cannot be obtained by members of other Sects, making each Sect's cosmetics truly exclusive.

---

### 2. Unlock New Martial Arts (Discounted Learning)

Each Sect specializes in specific **Martial Arts**, and joining a Sect grants a **discount** when learning its associated weapon skills.

**Learning Cost Comparison**:
- **Sect Members**: Discounted Zhou Coins and materials
- **Non-Members**: Full price (standard cost)
- **Sectless Players**: **Increased cost** (penalty for not joining any Sect)

**Early Game Advantage**: If you plan to use a specific Martial Art (e.g., Panacea Fan for Healer builds), joining the associated Sect (Silver Needle) early in the game significantly reduces learning costs.

**Martial Arts by Sect**:
- **Thundercry Blade** → Well of Heaven
- **Panacea Fan / Inkwell Fan** → Silver Needle
- **Infernal Twinblades** → Midnight Blades
- **Mortal Rope Dart** → Nine Mortal Ways
- **Soulshade Umbrella** → Hollow Vale

See `/game-data/progression/martial-arts.md` for complete Martial Arts unlock methods.
