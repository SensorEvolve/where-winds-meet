---

### Armor

**Function**: Protective gear that provides defense and HP bonuses

**Armor Slots** (4 total):
1. **Head Armor** (Helms) - Boosts HP and defense
2. **Chest Armor** - Greatest defense boost, most important HP increase
3. **Leg Armor** (Greaves) - Physical defense and HP
4. **Arm Armor** (Bracers) - Protection and HP boosts

**Additional Slots**:
- **Waist Armor** - Additional defensive slot
- **Foot Armor** - Leg protection

- Amounts vary by tier and Mastery level

**Secondary Attributes** (random):
- Momentum
- Attack
- Additional Physical Defense
- Additional Max HP
- And more (increasingly common at higher levels)

**Rerolling**:
- Players can reroll secondary attributes (limited uses, costs resources)
- Can use unwanted gear to improve items and potentially roll better attributes
- Focus on rerolling at higher levels when upgrading matters most

---

### Accessories

**Three Types**:

#### 1. Discs (Offensive Equipment)

**Primary Function**: Boost **minimum Physical Attack**

**Additional Attributes**:
- Specialized attack bonuses (Silkbind, Bellstrike, etc.)
- Varies by tier and rarity

**Set Bonuses**: Contributes to Offensive Equipment Sets (with Pendants and Weapons)

---

#### 2. Pendants (Offensive Equipment)

**Primary Function**: Boost **maximum Physical Attack**

**Additional Attributes**:
- Specialized attack bonuses (Silkbind, Bellstrike, etc.)
- Varies by tier and rarity

**Passive Abilities**: Rings come with unique passive abilities (revolve around Bow and Bow Skills)

**Set Bonuses**: Rings do NOT contribute to Set Bonuses (separate from Armor and Offensive Sets)

---

## Gear Enhancement Systems

### 1. Slot Enhancement

**Concept**: Enhance the **slot itself**, not individual gear pieces

**How It Works**:
- Upgrades apply to the slot (Head, Chest, Legs, Arms, etc.)
- Any equipment placed in that slot benefits from the enhancement
- Permanent upgrades that persist across gear changes

**Requirements**:
- Specific materials needed to level up each slot
- Enhancement limited by the level of gear currently equipped in the slot
- Must regularly replace old gear with higher-level gear to continue upgrading

**Material Location**:
- Click material icon in enhancement menu
- Scroll to "How to Obtain" section on tooltip

**Benefits**:
- Long-term investment in character power
- Don't lose progress when switching gear
- Scales with gear level

---

### 2. Tuning

**Concept**: Add additional stats to a **specific item**

**How It Works**:
- Item-specific customization (unlike Slot Enhancement)
- Adds extra stats to the gear piece
- Higher quality/rarity gear = more stat slots to unlock

**Special Tuning**:
- High quality gear can be tuned for **Path-specific bonus effects**
- Requires special items to unlock Path bonuses

**When to Use**:
- Focus on high-rarity gear you plan to keep
- Save resources for endgame tuning
- Pair with Set Bonuses for optimal builds

---

### 3. Mastery

**Concept**: Store unused gear in Arsenal for **Path-specific attribute bonuses**

**How It Works**:
- Arsenal stores gear you no longer actively use
- Enhancing Mastery of gear types grants Path bonuses
- Bonuses based on your chosen Path

**Path Examples**:
- **General** - Increases Physical Attack (General)
- **Bellstrike** - Increases Bellstrike Path Attack (DPS)
- **Stonesplit** - Increases Stonesplit Path Attack (Tanking)
- **Skillbind** - Increases Skillbind Path Attack
- **Bamboocut** - Increases Bamboocut Path Attack

**Related Systems**:
- See `/game-data/progression/inner-ways.md` for Weapon Path details
- Paths: Bellstrike (Umbra/Splendor), Stonesplit (Might), Skillbind (Jade/Deluge), Bamboocut (Wind)

**Benefits**:
- Passive power increases from old gear
- Encourages collecting diverse gear types
- Path specialization rewards

---

## Gear Sets

### Overview

**Set Bonuses**: Special effects granted when wearing multiple pieces from the same set

**Standard Structure**:
- **2-Piece Bonus**: Unlocked when wearing 2 pieces from the set
- **4-Piece Bonus**: Unlocked when wearing all 4 pieces from the set

**Set Types**:
1. **Armor Sets** - 4 pieces (Head, Chest, Legs, Arms)
2. **Offensive Equipment Sets** - Weapons + Discs + Pendants
3. **Bow Equipment** - Rings (no Set Bonuses, but unique Passive Abilities)

**Important**: Offensive Equipment and Bow Equipment have **separate** Set Bonuses that can't be mixed with Armor Set Bonuses

**Strategy**:
- Set Bonuses often more important than secondary attributes
- Match Set Bonuses to playstyle and combat role
- Sets correspond to Martial Arts schools and combat roles (Tank, Healer, DPS)

## Advanced Gear Tips

### 1. Mixing Set Bonuses

**Concept**: Use 2-piece bonuses from two different sets instead of one 4-piece

**Example**:
- Jadeware 2-piece (Max Physical Attack +1)
- Hawkwing 2-piece (Affinity Rate +0.1%)
- Result: Increased Affinity Rate and Max Attack without 4-piece effects

**When to Use**:
- 2-piece bonuses from both sets are strong
- 4-piece bonuses don't fit your playstyle
- Optimizing specific stats over set effects

**Caution**: Usually 4-piece bonuses are more impactful than stat increases

---

### 2. Path Tuning Priority

**High-Rarity Gear Only**: Save Path Tuning for your best gear

**Path Alignment**:
- Match Tuning to your Martial Arts Path
- **Bellstrike Tuning** → Bellstrike weapons (Strategic Sword, Flowing Spear, etc.)
- **Stonesplit Tuning** → Stonesplit weapons (Thundercry Blade, Stormbreaker Spear, etc.)

**Resource Management**:
- Tuning costs valuable resources
- Don't waste on gear you'll replace soon

---

### 3. Mastery Arsenal Management

**Store Everything**: Don't delete old gear, store it in Arsenal

**Diversify**:
- Collect all weapon types for Mastery bonuses
- Even if you don't use a weapon, its Mastery helps your Path

**Path Specialization**:
- Focus Mastery on weapons matching your chosen Path
- Prioritize General Mastery early for baseline Physical Attack

---

### 4. Rerolling Strategy

**Save for Endgame**:
- Limited reroll attempts and costly resources
- Focus on gear you'll keep long-term

**Target Stats**:
- Reroll for stats matching your combat role
- Tank: Defense, HP
- DPS: Attack, Affinity, Critical
- Healer: HP, Defense, Shield-related

**Use Unwanted Gear**:
- Feed low-quality gear into reroll process
- Potentially improves the item's attributes

---

### 5. Gear Chest Optimization

**Weekly Shop Priority**:
- Always buy Gear Chests from Weekly Shop (limited stock)
- Choose Set type based on current needs

**Dungeon Farming**:
- Identify which dungeons drop your target Set
- Farm efficiently for specific Sets

**Set Selection**:
- Research Set before opening chest
- Commit to a combat role before mass-opening chests

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Should I focus on Armor Sets or Offensive Equipment Sets first?**
A: Both are important. Prioritize Armor Sets early for survivability, then optimize Offensive Sets for damage.

**Q: Can I mix Armor Set pieces with Offensive Equipment Set pieces?**
A: Yes! Armor and Offensive Equipment have separate Set Bonuses. You can have a 4-piece Armor Set AND a 4-piece Offensive Set active simultaneously.

**Q: Do Rings contribute to Set Bonuses?**
A: No. Rings are Bow Equipment and don't contribute to Armor or Offensive Sets, but they have unique Passive Abilities.

**Q: What happens to Slot Enhancement if I remove gear from that slot?**
A: Slot Enhancement is permanent and tied to the slot itself. Any future gear in that slot benefits from the enhancement.

**Q: Can I transfer Tuning from one item to another?**
A: No. Tuning is item-specific and cannot be transferred. This is why you should only Tune gear you plan to keep.

**Q: What is the difference between Discs and Pendants?**
A: Discs increase **minimum Physical Attack**, while Pendants increase **maximum Physical Attack**. Otherwise, they function identically.

**Q: How do I unlock Path-specific Tuning?**
A: Obtain special items (specific materials) that enable Path Tuning on high-quality gear.

**Q: Should I save Gear Chests or open them immediately?**
A: Save them until you've decided on a combat role and Set to pursue. Opening blindly wastes the Set selection feature.

**Q: Can I preview Set Bonuses before committing to a Set?**
A: Yes, check this guide or in-game Set descriptions before selecting a Set from Gear Chests.

**Q: How does Mastery work if I change Paths?**
A: Mastery bonuses are Path-specific. If you change Paths, you'll receive different bonuses from the same Arsenal.
