# Where Winds Meet - Martial Arts (武术)

## Martial Arts System Overview

**Total Count**: 12 Martial Arts (one per weapon)

**Type**: Weapon-dependent combat skills

**Key Concept**: Martial Arts are the core combat skills tied to your weapon choice. Each weapon has its own unique set of skills including Main skills, Basic attacks, and Charged attacks.

## How Martial Arts Work

### Weapon Dependency

### Skill Structure

Each weapon's Martial Art includes:

**Main Skills**:
- Primary combat abilities
- Special techniques unique to the weapon
- Conversion skills for tactical options

**Basic Skills**:
- Light Attack combos
- Fundamental strikes
- Quick, low-cost attacks

**Charged Skills**:
- Heavy Attack variants
