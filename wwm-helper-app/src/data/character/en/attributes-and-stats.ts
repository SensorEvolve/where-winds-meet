## Combat Mechanics Summary

### Hit Types and Damage Calculation

1. **Precision Hits** (determined by Precision Rate)
   - Can trigger Critical (deals +35% damage, +50% healing)
   - Can trigger Affinity (deals +20% damage based on Max Attack)
   - Base damage uses normal attack calculation

2. **Non-Precision Hits**
   - Can trigger Abrasion (uses Min Attack for damage)
   - Can trigger Affinity (deals +20% damage based on Max Attack)
   - Generally lower damage than Precision Hits

3. **Critical Hits** (only from Precision Hits)
   - Requires Precision Hit first
   - +35% damage baseline
   - Scaled by Critical Damage Bonus
   - +50% healing for healing abilities

4. **Affinity Hits** (can occur on any hit)
   - Independent of Precision
   - +20% damage baseline
   - Scaled by Affinity Damage Bonus
   - Uses Max Attack for damage calculation

### Damage Scaling Formula (Simplified)

**Base Damage** = Physical Attack × Skill Multiplier
**After Precision Check** = Base Damage (if Precision) or Min Attack (if Abrasion)
**After Critical Check** = Damage × 1.35 × Critical Damage Bonus (if Critical)
**After Affinity Check** = Damage × 1.20 × Affinity Damage Bonus (if Affinity)
**After Penetration** = Damage adjusted by Penetration vs Resistance
**Final Damage** = Previous × Damage Bonus × (1 - Enemy Damage Reduction)
