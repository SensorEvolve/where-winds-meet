## Weapon Stats

**Damage is Randomly Based on Minimum and Maximum Attack**

Weapon damage is calculated using a Physical Attack stat range:
- Example: Weapon with **Physical Attack 10-16**
- Each hit randomly applies damage between 10 and 16
- Min and Max values determine damage consistency and burst potential

**Strategic Implications**:
- **High Min Attack**: More consistent damage, reliable DPS
- **High Max Attack**: Higher burst potential, better for critical builds
- **Wide Range**: Variable damage, gambling playstyle
- **Narrow Range**: Predictable damage output

Weapons gain additional substat slots as they reach higher tiers:

| Weapon Tier | Substats Available | Notes |

| Tier 41+ | 2 substats | Tuning unlocks second slot |
| Tier 51+ | 3 substats | Third slot becomes available |
| Tier 56+ | 4 substats | Maximum substats (endgame) |

### Tuning Material Weapons

**Special Weapon Property**: Some weapons can gain a **Tuning Material substat**

- Provide **guaranteed substat rarity** when used for tuning:
  - **Purple Stone Icon** 🟣: Guarantees Purple or higher substat rarity
  - **Gold Stone Icon** 🟡: Guarantees Gold (Legendary) substat rarity

**Strategic Value**:
- Don't discard weapons with tuning material substats
- Save them for tuning your endgame weapons
- Gold stone weapons are especially valuable for BiS weapon tuning
