Path Guides in Where Winds Meet are concise recommendations that show how to build a character to fulfill a specific role (such as DPS Melee, Heal Ranged, or Tank Melee). Each guide explains the key stats, Inner Ways priorities, gear choices, and playstyle considerations needed to reliably perform that role.

Use Path Guides as a starting blueprint: they highlight the core synergies and tradeoffs so you can adapt the build to your preferred weapons, traits, available gear, and playstyle.
